## Getting Started

> This is guide will keep things easy for the user to understand as not everybody has the same understanding of using cryptocurrencies.

The very first thing you should do is head on over to Mimosa's cold wallet generator (aka paper wallet) and create yourself a new
wallet. Be sure to save all your keys in a safe place, if you loose the important information to your wallet then there is no 
other way to restore it! Anyway, lets get creating that first Mimosa wallet.

Firstly, you want to head on over to `insert wallet website here once completed`. 

After you have created your first wallet and stored the information given, you then want to grab yourself some Mimosa binaries.
As we are going _step-by-step_ through this, we will dive straight into the deep end by getting started with using Mimosa's
daemon, often to referred to as a node. This is the primary software of use when it comes to Mimosa as the blockchain stays
online by people running public _nodes_. This is what we call decentralised where there is no central authority, everyone is
equal when it comes to the blockchain.

> As the common user tends to be a Windows user, we will be running all examples from a Windows Point-of-View.

Now we're going to obtain the Mimosa binaries we need in order to get started and the safest place to download these binaries
are from the official `Mimosa` repo in the releases section as these are provided straight from the developing team.
